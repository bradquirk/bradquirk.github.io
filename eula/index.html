                            <p>The Parties are independent contractors under these Terms and expressly disclaim any partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, employer/employee, fiduciary or other special relationship. Neither Party intends these Terms
                                to benefit, or create any right or cause of action in or on behalf of, any person or entity other than the Parties and listed affiliates. These Terms are not intended to create a third-party beneficiary of any kind. You
                                must not represent to any third party that it has any right to bind us in any manner and you will not to make any representations or warranties on behalf of us.</p>

                                (ii) Severability</span></u></h5>
                            <p>If a court holds that any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the court will modify the provision to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable or, if it cannot be made
                                valid and enforceable, the court will sever and delete the provision from these Terms. The change will affect neither the validity of the amended provision nor the validity of any other provision of these Terms, which will
                                continue in full force and effect.</p>

                            <p>A Party’s failure or delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of the right to enforce that provision or any other provision of these Terms at any time. A waiver of any provision of these
                                Terms must be in writing, specify the provision to be waived and signed by the Party agreeing to the waiver.</p>

                                vendors, fire, flood, earthquake, accident, radiation, inability to secure transportation, failure of communications or energy sources, malicious damage, breakdown of plant or machinery, or default of suppliers or sub-contractors.<br>                                Neither Party is liable for delays or failures to perform any of its obligations under these Terms to the extent caused by a Force Majeure Event.</p>

                                Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Melbourne, Victoria for any actions for which
                                we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade
                                secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below. If you are a consumer, this agreement does not exclude any rights you may have under the national
                                consumer laws of your jurisdiction.</p>
