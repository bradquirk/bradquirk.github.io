These Terms do not permit the installation or use of multiple copies of the SaaS Products on a system that allows shared use of applications. Multiple copy use or installation is only allowed if you obtain the appropriate license for each copy of the SaaS Products. Furthermore, the SaaS Products may only be installed and used on the hardware systems you own, lease or which are controlled by you, or your third party service provider, providing you remain responsible for the third party’s compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms.</p>

                    <p>The SaaS Products are licensed to you either on a Subscription License, an Evaluation License, or a Free License (as further defined under section 4(iii) of the Terms) subject to the following terms:</p>
                    <h5><u>(i) Subscription License</u></h5>
                    <p>Subscription-Based SaaS Products shall be granted on a time specific limit as per the subscription license (“<span class="amber-text">Subscription License</span>”) providing you with a worldwide, non-exclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable use of the Subscription-Based SaaS Products, subject to automatic renewal for successive monthly or annual terms unless either Party notifies the other of nonrenewal or we cease to make a particular Subscription Service available. If you cancel the Subscription-Based SaaS Products, your subscription will terminate at the end of the then-current billing cycle, and you will not be entitled to any refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.<br>
                        You acknowledge and agree to the use of the Subscription-Based SaaS Products, which are provided to you as a cloud service, and are hosted by us and/or the Atlassian Marketplace Platform. You also acknowledge and agree that Quirk Consulting and/or the Atlassian Marketplace Platform may make changes to the Subscription-Based SaaS Products from time to time.</p>
                    <h5><u><span><br>
                        (ii) Evaluation License</span></u></h5>
                    <p>We may provide you, at our sole discretion, with a limited license for the purposes of assessing the functionality of the SaaS Products (“<span class="amber-text">Evaluation License</span>”). The Evaluation License will provide you with the full version of the SaaS Product(s) for free for thirty (30) days) (“<span class="amber-text">Evaluation Period</span>”), after which you must either purchase or uninstall the SaaS Product. Upon the expiry of the Evaluation Period, you shall be obligated to pay for the full license fee or stop using the SaaS Products and all components of the SaaS Products shall cease to function.</p>
                    <h5><u><span><br>
                        (iii) Free License</span></u></h5>
                    <p>Free SaaS Products shall be granted to you at no cost, and shall be provided to you on a time-limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited license (“<span class="amber-text">Free License</span>”). Your use of the Free SaaS Products shall be subject to any other terms and conditions as we deem necessary and shall be for a stipulated period of time.</p>
                    <p>You acknowledge that we may cancel the Free SaaS Products at any time and for whatever reason, in our sole discretion. You may, however; upgrade to a similar product offered as a Subscription-Based SaaS Product, if available, and all your applicable data will be transferred by us automatically.</p>

The arbitration will be conducted in Melbourne, Victoria, unless you and Quirk Consulting agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Quirk Consulting are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
