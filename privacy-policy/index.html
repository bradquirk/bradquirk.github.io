<p>LAST UPDATED: 12 JANUARY, 2020</p>

<h3 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Quirk Consulting (“We”, “Us”, the “Company”, or “ Quirk Consulting ”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We want to tell You (“you”, “your” or “end-user”) how we use and protect your personal information or data (“Personal Data”). This includes informing You of your rights regarding your Personal Data that we hold.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) covers the information we collect about you when you use our products or services, including all of our SaaS/Cloud software products and our downloadable software products (collectively, the “Apps”) and all public websites (“Website(s)”) provided and/or maintained by Quirk Consulting, or otherwise interact with us (for example, by contact us through email or Jira Service Desk). We refer to all of these products, Apps, and Websites, together with our other services as “Services” in this Policy. “You” means the end-user of our products or the legal entity who is the licensee of our products, or the visitor of our public websites.</p>

<p>This Policy sets out how we may use, process and store your Personal Data. We may get that information from You or our partners, through contracts or other legal arrangements You have with us or our partners on behalf of us, in order to deliver contractual/legal obligations. In other cases, we will get that information from You with your permission and consent, or we may receive your Personal Data from third parties who You have given consent to pass this information on to us.</p>

<p>Many of our Services are intended for use by organisations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organisation (e.g., your employer), that organisation is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for controlling the access. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that Quirk Consulting’s policies.</p>

<p>Administrators are able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>restrict your access to the Services and therefore restrict your ability to edit, modify or delete your Personal Data; and
access, modify and remove the information about you.</li>
  <li>Even if the Services are not currently administered or made available to you by an organisation, if you use an email address provided by an organisation (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and your use of the Services at a later date.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account and your use of the Services, please use your personal email address to register for or access the Services.</p>

<h3 id="cookies">COOKIES</h3>

<p><em>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</em></p>

<p>Cookies are small files which are stored on a user’s computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website. This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user, or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.</p>

<p>We use cookies in our Services to save session data (for example to store your configuration inputs). The Atlassian Connect framework and JIRA use cookies in the authentication and authorisation process, which are sent to Our servers. These cookies are then employed to secure communication and match the request to customer and end-user data that we store.</p>

<p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however, please note that if You do this You may not be able to use the full functionality of the Website or Services.</p>
