                    <p>Cookies are small files which are stored on a user’s computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website. This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user, or
                        the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.</p>
                    <p>We use cookies in our Services to save session data (for example to store your configuration inputs). The Atlassian Connect framework and JIRA use cookies in the authentication and authorisation process, which are sent to Our servers.
                        These cookies are then employed to secure communication and match the request to customer and end-user data that we store.</p>
                    <p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however, please note that if You do this You may not be able to use the full functionality of the Website or Services.</p>
